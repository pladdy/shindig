## Shindig
### Because testing should be a bash!

Shindig is my attempt at writing a testing framework in and for bash scripts.
It's not that sexy or exciting, and it might not even become useful, but I'm
having a blast writing it!

The goal is to create a fairly easy to use DSL-like set of functions that
allows some testing of stuff.  This is loosely inspired by clojure.test and
Rspec since that's where I've written tests before.
